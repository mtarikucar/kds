# HummyTummy - Executive Summary

**Seed Round Investment Memorandum**

---

## Company Overview

HummyTummy is a cloud-native restaurant management platform that unifies Point of Sale (POS), Kitchen Display System (KDS), QR Menu ordering, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) into a single, affordable solution. Unlike traditional POS systems that require expensive hardware investments of $3,000-$15,000, HummyTummy operates entirely in the cloud, enabling restaurants to launch in under an hour with zero upfront hardware costs.

---

## The Problem

The restaurant industry faces a critical technology gap:

- **High Costs**: Traditional POS systems require $3,000-$15,000 in hardware plus monthly fees
- **Fragmented Solutions**: Restaurants juggle 4-5 separate systems for orders, kitchen, loyalty, and delivery
- **Lost Revenue**: No integrated customer data means no personalized loyalty programs
- **Delivery Chaos**: Manual re-entry of orders from Trendyol, Yemeksepeti, Getir costs time and causes errors
- **Complex Setup**: Weeks of installation and training before going live

With 60% of restaurants closing within 3 years and average profit margins of only 3-5%, technology should help—not hinder—restaurant success.
