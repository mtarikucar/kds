# Dataset description
description: |
  Custom dataset for restaurant person detection.
  Focuses on:
  - Seated customers at tables
  - Standing customers (waiting, ordering)
  - Walking customers
  - Crowded scenarios
  - Various lighting conditions
  - Multiple camera angles

# Annotation format
annotation_format: yolo  # YOLO format: class x_center y_center width height

# Data collection guidelines
collection_guidelines:
  camera_angles:
    - overhead (ceiling mounted)
    - corner mounted (45-60 degree angle)
    - wall mounted (eye level)

  scenarios:
    - empty restaurant
    - light traffic (1-5 people)
    - medium traffic (5-15 people)
    - busy periods (15+ people)
    - peak hours

  lighting:
    - daylight (natural)
    - artificial (evening)
    - mixed (transitional)
    - low light
    - spot lighting

  occlusion:
    - clear view
    - partial occlusion (tables, chairs)
    - heavy occlusion (crowded)

# Quality requirements
